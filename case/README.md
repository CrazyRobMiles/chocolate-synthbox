# Case

There are versions of the case for two sizes of led matrix. 

The case is created by a Python program that can be used to generate cases containing a large number of different elements. The program is called **BoxMacro.FCMacro** and runs inside the FreeCAD design tool which you can download from [here](https://www.freecadweb.org/downloads.php).

Each element in an enclosure is represented by one or more classes which are then automatically placed inside the base or the lid of the case. It is a bit of a pain to work with, I call it "3,000 lines of technical debt" but it does the job.
